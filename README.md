<h1 align="center" id="title">Peek URL Checker Extension</h1>

<p id="description">This is an extension designed to help safely navigate shortlinks found across the web (i.e. bit.ly tinyurl etc.) - particularly those where you may not know the final destination when you begin navigation. Stay safe online by checking the route of URLs before accessing them. See the final destination URL and a snapshot of the site (API key required).</p>
